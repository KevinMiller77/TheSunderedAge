### Lore
Long ago, the plane of Eltaria was a thriving world filled with powerful magic and advanced technology. Its inhabitants lived in harmony, and the five colors of mana coexisted in balance. But when an ancient artifact, the Nexus of Unity, was shattered, it unleashed a cataclysmic event known as The Sundering. The destruction ravaged the plane, leaving behind a post-apocalyptic landscape scarred by the remnants of the past. The few survivors adapted to their new environment, scavenging the ruins of ancient civilizations to obtain resources and knowledge. As the world shifted, the mana of Eltaria became unstable, leading to the emergence of new and twisted forms of magic. New alliances were formed, and old rivalries were rekindled as the survivors fought for control over the remaining fragments of the Nexus of Unity, believed to hold the power to restore Eltaria to its former glory.
