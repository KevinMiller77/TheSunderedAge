### Lore (Card Distributions below Lore)
Long ago, the plane of Eltaria was a thriving world filled with powerful magic and advanced technology. Its inhabitants lived in harmony, and the five factions coexisted in balance. But when an ancient artifact, the Nexus of Unity, was shattered, it unleashed a cataclysmic event known as The Sundering. The destruction ravaged the plane, leaving behind a post-apocalyptic landscape scarred by the remnants of the past. The few survivors adapted to their new environment, scavenging the ruins of ancient civilizations to obtain resources and knowledge. As the world shifted, new alliances were formed, and old rivalries were rekindled as the survivors fought for control over the remaining fragments of the Nexus of Unity, believed to hold the power to restore Eltaria to its former glory.

The factions were led by powerful individuals, many of whom were Planeswalkers. Eryka, Light of Hope, led the faction of the faithful, who believed in the restoration of Eltaria through unity and cooperation. Xanar, Mind Weaver, sought knowledge above all else and led a group of scholars who believed that the secrets of the past held the key to their salvation. Lilith, Shadowborn, championed the cause of those who embraced the darkness, seeking power and control over others.

Freya, Wildspeaker, championed the cause of the wild creatures of Eltaria, seeking to preserve the balance between civilization and nature. Serenia, Nature's Balance, was a powerful druid who sought to maintain equilibrium between the forces of growth and decay. Vis, Reality Weaver, believed in the power of imagination and the strength of the mind to shape the world around them. Ixara, Temporal Adept, sought mastery over time itself, manipulating the flow of events to her advantage.

Zephyr, Dreamshaper, wove the fabric of dreams and desires, inspiring a faction of artists and visionaries who believed in the power of creativity to change the world.

These legendary figures shaped the course of history on Eltaria, as their factions vied for control of the Nexus of Unity. As the battles raged on, the planeswalkersand their followers forged alliances and faced betrayals, shaping the fate of the plane. The struggle for the fragments of the Nexus of Unity continued, as each faction believed that the power within could restore Eltaria to its former glory or reshape it according to their vision.

Amidst the turmoil, unlikely friendships were forged, and bitter enemies found common ground. Some planeswalkers discovered that their goals were not as different as they once believed, and they began to work together to heal the scars left by The Sundering. In time, the people of Eltaria learned that their strength lay not in the power of the Nexus of Unity, but in their ability to overcome adversity and rebuild their world together.

As the factions continued to evolve and adapt, they realized that the true power of Eltaria lay in the hearts and minds of its people. The planeswalkers and their followers put aside their differences and embraced the diverse abilities and perspectives that each brought to the table. They learned that, together, they could create a brighter future for Eltaria, built on the foundations of their shared history and the lessons learned from the past.

The journey to restore Eltaria was long and filled with challenges, but through determination, cooperation, and the strength of their convictions, the people of the plane embarked on a new era of growth and prosperity. United by a common purpose and guided by the wisdom of the planeswalkers and legendary figures who led them, the survivors of The Sundering forged a new destiny for Eltaria, one that honored the legacy of their world while embracing the possibilities of the future.
